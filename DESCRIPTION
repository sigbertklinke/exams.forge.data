Description: The dataset collection supports Pearson correlation and linear regression analysis, 
    with datasets for n=100,200,400,800,1000, where n is the sum of squared values in x.
    Each dataset has x values summing to zero, with sample sizes (observations in x) ranging 
    from 2 to 10. Additional data frames include variables with German names and measurement levels, 
    and distribution details with R function names, LaTeX names, discreteness, and package origins.
